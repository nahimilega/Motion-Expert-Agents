# Dara Denny: Uncover winning patterns in your ads  

## Dara Denny Workflow
1. Fetch active meta ads
2. Extract winning and loosing patterns
3. Combine with Dara's market knowledge
4. Generate what's working, what's not, and recommendations (in json format)

### Sample Output
```
{
  "recommendations": {
    "whats_working": [
      "Personalized Messaging: Ads using personalized headings like 'For the Boyfriends who loves flaunting his shoes' resonate well with specific audience segments, leveraging identity and personal connection.",
      "Direct and Actionable CTAs: Clear CTAs such as 'Shop Now' and 'Starting at just ₹500 Per Month' effectively drive immediate action by reducing decision-making friction.",
      "Visuals and Product Display: Bright yellow backgrounds and clean visuals highlight the product's benefits, making the ads stand out and capture attention."
    ],
    "whats_not_working": [
      "Visual Contrast and Clarity: Split-screen designs and cluttered visuals fail to communicate product benefits effectively, leading to lower engagement.",
      "Messaging and Emotional Engagement: Negative comparisons and lack of emotional storytelling result in weak messaging that doesn't resonate with the audience.",
      "Discount Strategy and Pricing: 'Up to 50% OFF' lacks specificity and can be perceived as misleading, reducing trust in the offer."
    ],
    "action_items": [
      "Enhance Visual Appeal: Implement single-focus imagery with high color contrast (70:30 ratio of primary to accent colors) to increase CTR by an estimated 15-20%. A/B test lifestyle imagery against product-only shots to identify optimal visual strategy.",
      "Refine Messaging: Develop 3-5 personalized audience segments with tailored messaging that leverages emotional triggers. Data shows personalized ads achieve 29% higher conversion rates and 5x higher CTR than generic alternatives.",
      "Clarify Discounts: Replace 'Up to X% OFF' messaging with transparent fixed discounts. Studies indicate specific offers like 'Flat 30% OFF' drive 27% higher conversion rates than variable discounts, with 68% of consumers citing transparency as a key trust factor.",
      "Implement Social Proof: Add customer testimonials or review scores to ads, as campaigns featuring social proof elements see an average 35% increase in conversion rates and 22% higher engagement metrics."    
    ]
  }
}
```
## Design Consideration
- **Modular Design:** Each step in the workflow is encapsulated as a separate module (Single Responsibility), allowing for easy extension. Different types of workflows can be created by combining different steps using **Builder Pattern**

```
pipeline.addTask(new FetchMetaAdsWithImage())
.addTask(new IdentifyBrandType())
.addTask(new FindStaticHighPerformingPattern())
.addTask(new FindStaticLowPerformingPattern())
.addTask(new GenerateRecommendations());
pipeline.execute(context)
```
- This is done via **Template Method Pattern** with abstract class WorkflowStep and concrete implementations for each step in the pipeline.

```
export abstract class WorkflowStep {
  async validate(context: WorkflowPipelineContext): Promise<void> 
  abstract execute(context: WorkflowPipelineContext): Promise<WorkflowPipelineContext>;
}
```
```
export class FindStaticHighPerformingPattern extends WorkflowStep {
  outputKey: string = "highPerformingPatterns";

  async execute(context: WorkflowPipelineContext): Promise<WorkflowPipelineContext> {
    const results = await findPatternInHighPerformingStaticAds(context["metaAds"]);

    return {
      ...context,
      [this.outputKey]: results,
    };
  }
}
```
This approach offers several benefits:
- **Decoupling**: Logic is separated from workflow construction
- **Reusability**: Steps can be reused in different workflows
- **Extensibility**: New steps can be added without modifying existing code


### Technical Implementation
- **Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js
- **Integration:** Meta API, OpenAI API

## Project Structure
**Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries and decoupling between data access, intelligence, models, and workflow steps

```

## Error Handling
- **Axios interceptors** for centralized request/response error processing
- **Exponential backoff with jitter** for optimal retry distribution
- **Graceful pagination failure** with partial results and detailed statistics for Meta API
- **Function result validation** with specialized error handling for tool calls for OpenAI API


## Assumptions & Limitations

### Core Assumptions
- Revenue is the primary optimization metric
- Analysis is limited to image-based ads only (for MVP simplicity)
- Facebook User Token and Account ID are provided as input and are valid

### Technical Considerations
- Minimum threshold of 5 ads required for pattern analysis
- Temporary URLs from Facebook API are acceptable
- In-memory storage is used instead of persistent database (for easier setup)

### Data Handling
- Creatives with failed image fetching are excluded from analysis to maintain data quality
- Pattern analysis focuses on trend identification rather than individual ad performance, hence discarding few unfetched ads is acceptable
